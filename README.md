# WPF Editor Library
Simple editor-like functionality for a layer-based editor software.

# Q: Why did you make this?
I've started this library because one of my projects required me to have a lot of editor-like features, like the one presented in the example application. I didn't want the original application to be cluttered with that kind of functionality, so I've started factoring it out.

# Q: It's not very good, you are using WPF wrong. Why did you publish this?
I'm a very-very beginner WPF user, this was my first non-Hello-World interaction with the framework. I'm sure a lot of things could be improved, generalized or just switched out for something better. If you're a WPF pro and see something could be improved, please open an issue! I'd be happy to learn and improve. If you'd like to make a PR, feel free to do so!
